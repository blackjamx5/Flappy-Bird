# Flappy-Bird
First game created with Java

I coded this game almost from scratch during my introductory class to programming of last year. We were tasked to 
implement starter code from the professor to create the once populat side scroller game "Flappy Bird". "Flappy Bird" is a typical 
side scroller game in which you avoid obstacles.
